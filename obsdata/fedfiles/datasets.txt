IMPROVE Aerosol
Description: The Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) program is a cooperative measurement effort governed by a steering committee of representatives from Federal, state, and regional organizations. The IMPROVE monitoring program was established in 1985 to facilitate the creation of Federal and State implementation plans for the protection of visibility in Class I areas (156 national parks and wilderness areas) as stipulated by the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act.

IMPROVE Aerosol, Regional Haze Rule II (New Equation), with substituted data
Description:	An IMPROVE monitoring site can have missing data for various reasons, e.g. a power outage at the monitoring site. In some instances, there is enough missing data that the monitoring site fails the completeness criteria to calculate a valid haze metric for the Regional Haze Rule (RHR) baseline period (2000-2004). The RHR guidance documents has procedures for filling in some missing values with “patched” data; however this criteria is strict and few values are actually filled in. A number of States have developed different procedures to fill in additional missing values and submitted these data to the VIEWS database. These data are referred to as “substituted” data to differentiate them from the RHR “patched” data. Currently substituted data are available from 19 monitoring sites. These sites were selected because they either did not have the required 3 years of valid data to calculate the RHR haze metrics for the baseline period or they did not have complete data for the year 2002. The Regional Planning Organizations modeled the year 2002 and monitoring data was needed to evaluate and use the modeling results.
